# COMP4037 Coursework 2 – GHG Emissions Visualization

This repository contains my submission for COMP4037 Research Methods Coursework 2, focused on advanced data visualization.

## 📊 Visualization

The main insight is visualized using a **scatterplot matrix**, created in Python with Seaborn. It explores greenhouse gas emissions (Total GHG, CH₄, N₂O) among **vegans and vegetarians** across different **age groups**.

## 🧠 Unique Insight

Individuals aged **18–29** following plant-based diets consistently show the **lowest emissions** across all three GHG indicators. This suggests that younger adults on vegan/vegetarian diets may have more environmentally sustainable behaviors.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
- Word / PowerPoint
- Video narration script (included in PPT)
